<h1>Active Directory Home Lab<br/> 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I was able to create an Active Directory home lab Environment using Oracle Virtual Box. Configuring and running this lab helped develop my understanding of how active directory and Windows networking works, so l'd highly recommend giving this lab a try in order to familiarize yourself with domain and networking environments. Please let me know if you have any questions!
